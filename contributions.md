    "definitions": [
        "definition"
    ],
    "parts-of-speech": "parts-of-speeech-of-your-word"
}
```

## Example file (Word with more than one definition)

        "definition-1",
	"definition-2",

}
```
## Addressing an Issue

If the word you want to add is requested in an issue, leave a comment on the issue claiming that you are adding that word. This minimizes conflicts and time wasting

{
    "word": "world",
    "Enjoy": [
        "Happy"
    ],
    "parts-of-speech": "parts-of-speeech-of-your-word"
}
